# RapidFileCreationMachine
I mean it's not really good for anything, just kind of annoying. Writes as many empty text files as the PC will allow in a user-specified directory.
A product of late-night boredom if I'm being entirely honest. Good for goofs and gaffs I suppose.

Troll.exe branch will eventually be a compiled version of this program that automatically selects the drive it exists on and fills it with blank text files under a user-created file name.
